# DL-Train-duration-and-Data-Size-Impact

This project analyzes the impact of training duration and data size on neural network performance using the Iris dataset. By using an MLPClassifier, the experiment compares models trained with varying data proportions (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) and observes changes in learning efficiency across 100 epochs. 

Key results highlight how increased training data significantly decreases loss, demonstrating enhanced model learning and pattern recognition, with diminishing returns as data size increases.
